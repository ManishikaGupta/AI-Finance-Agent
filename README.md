## *AI as Your Accountability Partner*

A conversational assistant that helps users **set savings goals** and track progress through subtle nudges and feedback.

- ✏️ **Input:** Define your financial goal (e.g., “Save ₹5000 this month”)
- 💬 **Response:** The bot evaluates your transaction data and guides you with suggestions like:
  - “You’ve already spent ₹1200 on food delivery—consider cutting down to meet your goal.”
- 👥 **For Whom:** Especially helpful for Gen Z users looking for personalized nudges rather than spreadsheets
